Bootstrap v3.3.1

 ================================================================
FIX 
 
 - blog user not showing in post delete view line 36; @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.BlogUser.FullName)
 

 - if can't find page throw error like if i type in page greater than total.
 - posts/index and blogpostindex view @item.BlogUser.FullName not working, fullname showing null; line36


 - contact form error on send
 - preview image on create and edit
		check contactpro contact profile image create and edit
		image uploads don't like svg


 - make sure only admin moderator can post
	regular users can comment only
	not logged in can view only

- add recent posts to blog cards
	

 - what is purpose of clicking on link of posted by 
 - comments index some info not showing [dont really need this]

 

 =========================================================================
 HOME INDEX
  - list of blogs with pagination
  - when click on read more of blog it records blogid and passes in url
		  so blogpostindex can show posts only for that blog
  - blog create view back button will go back to home index to correct page
 - read more button goes to blogpostindex for that blog

 + show recent posts
 + show latest comments
 + show latest categories
 + show all tags/distinct


   BLOGPOSTINDEX
  - BlogPostIndex method showing int? page as null
		clicking on blog in home index not passing page number
		would this work?
		@Html.Hidden("id", comment.Id)
		@Html.Hidden("Slug", comment.Posts.Slug)
 - set the post detail back button to go to blogpostindex later
 - the blog name isn't showing up in the create post view
 - the back to list link doesn't go to the page you were on - where?


 ==========================================================================
 STYLE  

 x = already comes with a preloader
 - remove all commented code
 - responsive
	posts searchindex view - search only includes production ready
		make result clickable / go to 
	post edit/create view needs styling on adding tags
	check other crud views for responsive even though i'm the only one to see it
	header may need bottom margin until left menu is reduced
	fluid images try not to stretch, maintain proportion
	text for post details content abstract and title
- consider making blog cards smaller
- consider scaffolding views for tags in case you want to edit them globally
- put tags on posts index card?

> maybe don't need pagination
	.hafe the featured blog/category under the carousel
	.and use the layout for the remaining catogiries left and right views

===================================================================================

// this isn't working on the layout page
// need to add this to create/edit/delete actions in index pages
@if (User.IsInRole("Administrator"))
{
	<li class="nav-item">
		<a class="nav-link" asp-area="" asp-controller="Blogs" asp-action="Index">Blogs</a>
	</li>
}


This trick worked on the post controller details method
				.Include(p => p.Blog)    /*added to try to access blog id for back to list link*/
				ViewData["BlogId"] = post.BlogId;
				<a asp-controller="Posts" asp-action="BlogPostIndex" asp-route-id="@ViewData["BlogId"]">Back to List</a>


@foreach (var comment in Model.Post.Comments.OrderByDescending(c => c.Created))
===============================================================================

@using DevBlog5.Services
@using DevBlog5.Enums

		 QUESTIONS

===================================================================================

I have some questions about the viewmodels.
The post detail view is based on the PostDetailViewModel. I'm assuming that this view can
access the tags because of this line in the model? - public List<string> Tags { get; set; } = new List<string>();
The post detail view also has the line - (@ViewData["HeaderImage"]). But the PostDetailViewModel doesn't have a ViewData line in it.
Is the detail view accessing both the Post, Tag and Comment models at the same time it is accessing the PostDetailViewModel?
It seems that the PostDetailViewModel is redundant.
For example the post detail view references the "Model.Post.Id", which I assume comes from the Post model, especially since
the PostDetailViewModel doesn't have a Post.Id.

So the ApplicationDbContext _context; line along with its constructor allows me to access anything in the database yes?
So any methods in that controller can access anything from Blog.Title to Comment.Text for example.
If that's the case I can access any and all of the table columns in the database inside a controller method like Index for example,
which would allow me to access all of that in the view correct?
And just to confirm the ViewModels are used for data that is not stored in a table in the database, and passes along
data for whatever reason other than storing in the database?
If thats the case why do we need the PostDetailViewModel? The info in there seems redundant.

What I am leading to is I would like to have a list of recent posts, recent blogs and system tags on my landing page,
that being the _layout page. I've tried using and inject statements in the _layout page but no success yet.
