Bootstrap v3.3.1

 ================================================================
FIX 
 
 - blog user not showing in post delete view line 36; @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.BlogUser.FullName)
 - posts/index and blogpostindex view @item.BlogUser.FullName not working, fullname showing null; line36
 

 - error page not found if i type in page greater than total.


 - image uploads don't like svg


 - make sure only admin moderator can post
	regular users can comment only
	not logged in can view only

- add recent posts to blog cards
	

 - user name click to show comments by and posted by - but i'm the only one who posts
 - comments index some info not showing [dont really need this]

 

 =========================================================================
 HOME INDEX
  - blog all crud back buttons will go back to home index to correct page

 + show recent posts
 + show latest comments
 + show latest categories
 + show all tags/distinct


   BLOGPOSTINDEX
   - needs back to home index page current page
  - BlogPostIndex method showing int? page as null
		clicking on blog in home index not passing page number
		would this work?
		@Html.Hidden("id", comment.Id)
		@Html.Hidden("Slug", comment.Posts.Slug)
 - set the post detail back button to go to blogpostindex later

 PostsEmpty page
  - go back to current page not working
 ==========================================================================
 STYLE  

 - create-post-header
 - adjust ticker speed

 - remove all commented code
 - responsive
	header may need bottom margin until left menu is reduced

- consider making blog cards smaller
- consider scaffolding views for tags in case you want to edit them globally
- put tags on posts index card?

> maybe don't need pagination
	.have the featured blog/category in the carousel
	.and use the layout for the remaining catogiries left and right views

===================================================================================

// this isn't working on the layout page
// need to add this to create/edit/delete actions in index pages
@if (User.IsInRole("Administrator"))
{
	<li class="nav-item">
		<a class="nav-link" asp-area="" asp-controller="Blogs" asp-action="Index">Blogs</a>
	</li>
}


This trick worked on the post controller details method
				.Include(p => p.Blog)    /*added to try to access blog id for back to list link*/
				ViewData["BlogId"] = post.BlogId;
				<a asp-controller="Posts" asp-action="BlogPostIndex" asp-route-id="@ViewData["BlogId"]">Back to List</a>


@foreach (var comment in Model.Post.Comments.OrderByDescending(c => c.Created))

		 QUESTIONS

===================================================================================

I have some questions about the viewmodels.
The post detail view is based on the PostDetailViewModel. I'm assuming that this view can
access the tags because of this line in the model? - public List<string> Tags { get; set; } = new List<string>();
The post detail view also has the line - (@ViewData["HeaderImage"]). But the PostDetailViewModel doesn't have a ViewData line in it.
Is the detail view accessing both the Post, Tag and Comment models at the same time it is accessing the PostDetailViewModel?
It seems that the PostDetailViewModel is redundant.
For example the post detail view references the "Model.Post.Id", which I assume comes from the Post model, especially since
the PostDetailViewModel doesn't have a Post.Id.

So the ApplicationDbContext _context; line along with its constructor allows me to access anything in the database yes?
So any methods in that controller can access anything from Blog.Title to Comment.Text for example.
If that's the case I can access any and all of the table columns in the database inside a controller method like Index for example,
which would allow me to access all of that in the view correct?
And just to confirm the ViewModels are used for data that is not stored in a table in the database, and passes along
data for whatever reason other than storing in the database?
If thats the case why do we need the PostDetailViewModel? The info in there seems redundant.

What I am leading to is I would like to have a list of recent posts, recent blogs and system tags on my landing page,
that being the _layout page. I've tried using and inject statements in the _layout page but no success yet.
