Bootstrap v3.3.1

 ================================================================
FIX 

 - two factor auth?
	  if so uncomment that section in the areas/accounts/register.cshtml
	  same for link in areas/accounts/manage/_ManageNav.cshtml

 - new post not showing in blogpostindex page
	**** keep forgeting to set it to production ready. *****

 $ I will need to keep the blog and posts indexes to see non-production ready blogs and posts
   ** set those links as admin only

 - eventually take the id's and maybe blog names from cards


 - make search bar part of ticker?

 - postsempty button create post for this blog
 
 - limit file upload types - see .net snippits

 


 - make sure only admin moderator can post
	regular users can comment only
	not logged in can view only

 =========================================================================
 HOME INDEX

 + show recent posts
 + show latest comments
 + show latest categories
 + show all tags/distinct


BLOGPOSTINDEX
+ add recent posts to blog cards ?view model?
+ put tags on posts index card?


 ==========================================================================
 STYLE  

 - remove all commented code
 - change all "Blog" to "Category"

 - socials at end of post view
 - cards break to soon, pics to big, keep 2 columns on header max width for photo
 - related posts section at end of posts view

- consider making blog cards smaller
- consider scaffolding views for tags in case you want to edit them globally
-  they will need post and blog id's and names on their cards

> maybe don't need pagination
	.have the featured blog/category in the carousel
	.and use the layout for the remaining catogiries left and right views

===================================================================================

// this isn't working on the layout page
// need to add this to create/edit/delete actions in index pages
@if (User.IsInRole("Administrator"))
{
	<li class="nav-item">
		<a class="nav-link" asp-area="" asp-controller="Blogs" asp-action="Index">Blogs</a>
	</li>
}


This trick worked on the post controller details method
				.Include(p => p.Blog)    /*added to try to access blog id for back to list link*/
				ViewData["BlogId"] = post.BlogId;
				<a asp-controller="Posts" asp-action="BlogPostIndex" asp-route-id="@ViewData["BlogId"]">Back to List</a>


@foreach (var comment in Model.Post.Comments.OrderByDescending(c => c.Created))

		 QUESTIONS

===================================================================================

I have some questions about the viewmodels.
The post detail view is based on the PostDetailViewModel. I'm assuming that this view can
access the tags because of this line in the model? - public List<string> Tags { get; set; } = new List<string>();
The post detail view also has the line - (@ViewData["HeaderImage"]). But the PostDetailViewModel doesn't have a ViewData line in it.
Is the detail view accessing both the Post, Tag and Comment models at the same time it is accessing the PostDetailViewModel?
It seems that the PostDetailViewModel is redundant.
For example the post detail view references the "Model.Post.Id", which I assume comes from the Post model, especially since
the PostDetailViewModel doesn't have a Post.Id.

So the ApplicationDbContext _context; line along with its constructor allows me to access anything in the database yes?
So any methods in that controller can access anything from Blog.Title to Comment.Text for example.
If that's the case I can access any and all of the table columns in the database inside a controller method like Index for example,
which would allow me to access all of that in the view correct?
And just to confirm the ViewModels are used for data that is not stored in a table in the database, and passes along
data for whatever reason other than storing in the database?
If thats the case why do we need the PostDetailViewModel? The info in there seems redundant.

What I am leading to is I would like to have a list of recent posts, recent blogs and system tags on my landing page,
that being the _layout page. I've tried using and inject statements in the _layout page but no success yet.
